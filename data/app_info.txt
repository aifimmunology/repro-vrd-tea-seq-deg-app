This app enables exploration of genes associated with single Multiple Myeloma drug perturbations in
normal T-cells in-vitro.  


Instructions:  

1) Toggle dropdowns to change volcano plot displayed  
2) Hover over volcano plot to view gene information.  
3) Click 'Annotate Volcano' pencil icon to select gene(s) of interest to label on the volcano plot. Select
   from dropdown or by clicking/box-selecting from volcano plot, copying and pasting into the box, or selecting
   a full geneset. Click 'Update Plots' to apply feature selection to all tabs.  
4) Click individual points on the volcano plot to select a single gene to plot on the all-analysis heatmap, 
   or select a gene from the heatmap dropdown
   a) Customize the heatmap view by clicking 'Heatmap Options' gear icon and changing selections.  

Analysis Details: 

DEG Results
    In vitro DEG's were calculated using MAST for each celltype and timepoint separately. Differences
    are determined for a given drug relative to the DMSO control at the same timepoint. The MAST model 
    implemented was: exp ~ treatment + CDR, where CDR is the cellular detection
    rate calculated as n_genes detected, mean-centered and scaled to unit variance across all cells. 
    Genes exhibiting less than 5% expression in all comparison groups in a cell type were excluded from analysis
    on a per-celltype basis.  
    
Gene Info
    Gene information is queried in real time using the mygene.info service via the mygene python package   
    
DEG Heatmap
    Heatmap displays the results of DEG analysis with color indicating effect size (log2FC) and significance 
    indicated by '*' (based on selected p-value input).
